Object Detection using OpenCV
A versatile and easy-to-use Python project for real-time object detection in images and video streams using the OpenCV library. This repository provides a clear and commented implementation suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking to integrate object detection into their applications.

🌟 Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Detect objects instantly using a live webcam feed.

Image & Video Analysis: Perform detection on static images (.jpg, .png) and pre-recorded videos (.mp4).

Model Support: Easily configurable to work with various pre-trained models. This implementation uses a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model, which is lightweight and efficient.

Customizable: Simple to modify the code to use different models (like YOLO or Haar Cascades) or to filter for specific object classes.

Clear Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them with the class name and confidence score.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
This project is built with Python and relies on the following libraries:

Python 3.8+

OpenCV-Python: The core library for all computer vision tasks.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3 installed on your system.

A webcam (for real-time detection).

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/object-detection-opencv.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/object-detection-opencv.git)
cd object-detection-opencv

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download Pre-trained Model Files
This project requires pre-trained model files to function. You will need to download the following files and place them in a model directory within the project's root folder:

MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt: The model architecture definition.

MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel: The pre-trained weights.

You can often find these files by searching for "MobileNet-SSD Caffe model files" online or from a trusted computer vision resource repository.

🖥️ Usage
You can run the object detection script from your terminal.

To Detect Objects in an Image
Place your image in the root directory and run the following command:

python detect.py --image your_image.jpg

A new window will pop up showing the image with detected objects.

To Detect Objects in Real-Time via Webcam
To start real-time detection, run the script without any arguments:

python detect.py

Press the q key to exit the webcam feed window.
